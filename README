Downloadable data for all schools by London Local Authority is available here:
 http://www.education.gov.uk/inyourarea/gors/gor_H.shtml

However, it doesn't include head master, telephone, email or url.

This scrapy crawler extracts all of this additional information from a number of local authority's .gov.uk sites, including: Barnet, Brent, Harrow and Ealing.

The UK govt's open data initiative hasn't properly reached this area yet, hence the need for crawlers. Some of the data for other local authorities is pretty dire, e.g. Camden: http://maps.camden.gov.uk/Nearest/Nearest.aspx?find=Primary%20school
